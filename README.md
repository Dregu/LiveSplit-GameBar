# LiveSplit-GameBar
LiveSplit timer overlay widget for Xbox Game Bar

Requires https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.Server running on localhost in the default port (16834).
Pretty crude, just polls the current time all the time really fast. It's just the timer, no splits or fancy stuff. (The server doesn't support fancy stuff...)
Doesn't show up on OBS game capture or anything, it's for your eyes only, if you only have a one monitor or something.

## Installation

I don't have a store dev account so it's not in widget store. You can build it in VS2019 or maybe install the test release (it's self signed, figure it out) if you manage to trust the packages certificate (add to "Trusted people" maybe? I dunno.)
