# LiveSplit-GameBar
LiveSplit timer overlay for Xbox Game Bar

Requires https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.Server running on localhost in the default port. Pretty crude, just polls the current time all the time really fast. The widget crashes (feature) when it can't connect to livesplit server, so start that first!
