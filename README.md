# LiveSplit-GameBar
LiveSplit speedrun timer overlay widget for Windows 10 Xbox Game Bar

Requires https://github.com/Xenira/LiveSplit-Websocket running on localhost in the default port (16835) so read the instructions for that first.
Shows current time and splits with colored deltas, comparing to your personal best or best segments.
There's no controls or settings, it just shows you what livesplit is doing, but right in your face.
Make it opaque or transparent in the xbox settings.
Resize the window to only show the parts you need.
Doesn't show up on OBS game capture, so this is not for streaming.
It's for your eyes only, if you're poor and only have one monitor or don't want to sprain your neck looking at your other monitor.

## Installation

I don't have a store dev account (yet?) so it's not in widget store.
You can build it in VS2019 or maybe install the test release (it's self signed, figure it out)
if you manage to trust the packages certificate (add to "Trusted people" maybe? I dunno I've never done this before!)
