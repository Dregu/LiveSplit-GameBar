# LiveSplit-GameBar
LiveSplit timer overlay for Xbox Game Bar

Requires https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.Server running on localhost in the default port. Pretty crude, just polls the current time all the time really fast. The widget crashes (it's a feature) when it can't connect to livesplit server, so start that first and then restart the widget in gamebar.
